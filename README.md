# video-player

In this project, I created my own custom video player and be able to control the functionality 
through my own custom UI.

Main Features:

1.Play and Pause through the button as well as click on the button.

2.Mute and unmute as well as we can drag the volume to different levels.

3.Dynamic progress bar, we can jump around in the video.

4.Tracking the current time of the video as well as the total duration.

5.Change the playback speed.

6.Fullscreen or exit fullscreen.

7.Work in different browsers.



So that's pretty much it for the functionality of this project.

Hope you enjoy the project too!
