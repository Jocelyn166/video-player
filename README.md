# Video Player

## Description
In this project, I created my custom video player and was able to control the functionality through my custom UI.

## Main Features

1. **Play and Pause**: Through the button as well as clicking on the video.
2. **Mute and Unmute**: Additionally, we can drag the volume to different levels.
3. **Dynamic Progress Bar**: We can jump around in the video.
4. **Tracking Time**: Monitoring the current time of the video as well as the total duration.
5. **Change Playback Speed**: Adjust the speed of video playback.
6. **Fullscreen Mode**: Enter and exit fullscreen mode.
7. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Works in different browsers.
